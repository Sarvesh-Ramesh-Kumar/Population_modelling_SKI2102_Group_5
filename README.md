# Population_modelling

DOCUMENTATION FILE! :))))

Task 1: Describe in your own words (max 300 words) the model and model parameters: How do the populations of the three species change in the model? What do the parameters represent? Add some documentation to the Matlab file of the model

TEST
​​The model is a three species model, composed of plants, hares and lynxs. It studies and represents the population changes of the three species as multiple parameters are modified. These parameters include; y0, the initial population sizes of each species, alpha (1 and 2), representing the predation success rate for both predators on their respective preys, this being a1 for the hare predation success rate on the plant and a2 for the lynx predation rate on the hare. Furthermore is the parameter beta (1 and 2), representing the population growth rate due to predation, b1 and b2 being the population growth rate of the hare (from predation on plants) and the lynx (from predation on hare) respectively. The last parameter, delta (1 and 2), represents the per capita death rate of the hare (d1) and the lynx (d2).
